Hello world, welcome to my little paradise, I'm Taha Ibrahim DRAIDIA, I'm a software developer interested in application security, binary exploitation, exploit developement, ethical hacking and bug bounties. I never wrote a blog before, this my first time, I hope you'll like my writings. Below are the reasons why I decided to start writing a blog:   
- I used to take notes on text files, they got messy
- I would like to share what I've learnt along my journey in computers
- I would like to increase my writing skills 
- I would like to get feed back about my code, researchs and methodologies
- I would like to feel more connected with people who share  the same interests  

Here is a list of topics which I'll be writing about:
- Ethical hacking  
- Bug bounties write-ups 
- My personnel security researchs 
- Computer programming 

Finaly, I'll end this post with my goals for 2018:  
- Improve  my communications and hacking skills
- Get involved in more open source projects and contribute to information  security community

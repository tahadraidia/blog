My name is Taha Draidia. I am a senior security consultant with a strong focus on vulnerability research, binary exploit development, OS internals, and low-level programming in C, C++, and assembly.

On this website, I share topics I’ve learned, security bugs I’ve found, tools I’ve written, and open-source contributions [[1]] [[2]] related to security research and software engineering.

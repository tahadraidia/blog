      <description>Background Python is one of the most used programming language nowadays specially due its popularity in data science, deep and machine learning fields; Truth to be told, under the hood there is C and/or C++ code running.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take for example some popular python libraries used in math and machine learn to illustrate that point:
 Numpy (33.2% of the code is written in C) TensorFlow (61% of the code is written in C++) PyTorch (53% of the code in written in C++ and 4% in C)  The raison that these libraries are build in C and/or C++ is for performance issues mainly, also it is important to note that Python is written in C, hence it provides a C API to extend the language by creating new modules at lower-level possible.</description>
